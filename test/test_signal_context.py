    Signalen API

    One of the tasks of a municipality is to maintain public spaces. When citizens have complaints about public spaces they can leave these complaints with the municipality. Signalen (SIG) receives these complaints and is used to track progress towards their resolution. SIG provides an API that is used both by the SIG frontend and external systems that integrate with SIG.
